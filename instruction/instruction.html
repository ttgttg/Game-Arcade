            TOP 5 TIPS TO GET STARTED:
          </h1>
          <h3 class="bodytext briefintro__text">
            1. The deck is evenly distributed between the players.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="bodytext briefintro__text">
            2. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one
            card face up in front of them.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="bodytext briefintro__text">
            3. As each player reveals their next card, the instant you see a
            total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If
            you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into
            your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="bodytext briefintro__text">
            4. When you run out of cards, you're out.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="bodytext briefintro__text">
            5. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck
            once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins!

          Place the bell in the middle of the table, on a cloth or a piece of
          felt to protect your table. <br />Select a dealer. He shuffles the
          cards and deals them out to the players, one at a time until all of
          the cards have been used up. <br />Each player places their deck face
          down on the table in front of them, without looking at their cards.

          <li>The player to the left of the dealer starts the game.</li>
          <li>
            Each player turns over the top card of their draw deck and places it
            face up on the table. These cards are each player's face-up discard
            pile.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each card is placed on top of this pile in such a way that it covers
            the previous card and only the top card is visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each player must try to ring the bell first as soon as the revealed
            cards show exactly 5 fruits of the same type.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first player to ring the bell when the revealed cards show
            exactly 5 fruits of the same sort wins all of the discard piles.
          </li>
          <li>
            The person who won then puts these face-up cards face down under
            their draw deck and starts a new round by turning over the first
            card.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a player runs out of cards, the player is not out of the game
            yet. The player still takes part in the game until the player has
            also lost their discard pile. Until then, the player skip revealing
            cards, but they can still ring the bell.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player rings the bell by mistake, and the revealed cards do not
            show exactly 5 fruits of the same type, they must give each of the
            other players one card from their draw pile as a penalty.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game is over when only 2 players are left in the round. They
            continue to play until one of them wins the face-up discard piles.
            There is a special ruling for this situation: if a player rings the
            bell by mistake, the player's opponent wins all of the cards in the
            face-up discard piles and the game is over. However if the players
            wish, they may continue until one of them wins all of the cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player holding the largest number of cards at the end of the
            round is the winner.
